            <h4>About Telurian</h4>
            <p>Rominimal comes from “romanian minimal” and if you happen to be active in or around the international
                club scene, chances are you've attended at least one such party in the past decade and you also probably
                have your own rominimal playlist by now.
                That's because this intriguing sub-genre managed to lure the crowds all over the world by its subtle
                samples
                and seductive beats packed together with slices of tech and micro-house on a foundation whose roots come
                from
                minimalist techno and trance music.</p>
            <p>It is hard to tell exactly where and when it all started. But early 2000, Club Zebra in Bacau - Romania
                (a city already famous for its vibrant and dynamic urban music scene) hired then 15yo Raresh as their
                resident DJ
                and he soon developed a local cult-following for his particular choice of music in the after-party
                hours, more
                underground and tech-orientated than the usual mainstream setlist. After several glorious years in Zebra
                Club,
                always having full support and leaving behind a new school of young musicians, he was sent to Bucharest
                and the
                style later developed after he teamed up with people that shared the same interest in this new approach
                to techno.
                Soon after, a bunch of talented Romanian DJ's and producers were spreading these cool vibes to the world
                and the
                rest is history in the making. Meanwhile, legendary parties continued in Zebra Club for many years, with
                more
                new-commers DJs becoming the brand names today, defining the club as fundamental in the romanian club
                scene and
                especially for rominimal music.</p>
            <p>Now and here, TELURIAN represents the musical statement of Zebra Records, the label who evolved from the
                cultural
                foundations laid by the eponymous famous club. This fine selection of never before published tracks
                offers both
                world-established artists as well as new kings, a carefully chosen tracklist we consider to be highly
                representative
                for the scene today, from old school dark underground to the sparkling sound of the new wave.
                This is what we call rominimal and Telurian is the next level. </p>
